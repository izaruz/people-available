# PEOPLE AVAILABLE TEST

This project is developed as a skills test.

For its development we used `REACT` and` Typescript`, the project consists of receiving a list of people with assigned meetings, and it is processed to be able to see what is the availability of the people per hour, and we also obtain data of in which schedules at least 3 people are free.

People's data is consumed from an external service using `axios`. The service was created to simulate a REST API.

To deploy the project, it is only necessary to download the repository and run the following commands:

* npm install
* npm start
